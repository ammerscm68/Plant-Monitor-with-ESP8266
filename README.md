# Plant-Monitor-with-ESP8266
A Plant Monitor with ESP8266 and Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

A "captive portal" is created when the software is started for the first time. (Name = Plant-Monitor)
Make the appropriate entries here. A website can be opened via the assigned IP address.
Should it ever be necessary to change the WLAN access data and other parameters, this can be
done by a RESET on the website. If this is not possible then simply
wait (when WLAN is switched off!) until the LED lights up blue and the "Captive Portal" starts again.
The new data can now be entered.
